First install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run with: `python main.py` for running experiments with default arguments.

If you want to set specific arguments, see `main.py` for all available arguments. By default logging is turned off, but an Wandb api key can be set via cmd args, which logs the metrics and the extracted functions to your Wandb account, otherwise it will be just printed in the command line.
